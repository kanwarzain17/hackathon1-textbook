# Contracts (UI Upgrade for Book Frontend)

This feature does not introduce external API contracts.

## Scope

- Theme styling changes
- Navbar / sidebar / footer UX adjustments
- Responsive behavior improvements

## Notes

If implementation work introduces new runtime configuration, telemetry, or external integrations, contracts should be added in a future feature (out of scope for this UI upgrade).

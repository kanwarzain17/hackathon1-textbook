# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-11
**Feature**: [specs/001-ros2-humanoid-module/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) -- *Confirmed: Content is at pedagogical/requirements level.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs -- *Confirmed: Focuses on student learning outcomes.*
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders -- *Confirmed: Language is accessible.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed -- *Confirmed.*

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain -- *None present.*
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous -- *Requirements FR-001 through FR-005 are clear.*
- [x] Success criteria are measurable -- *SC-001 to SC-004 include clear targets.*
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) -- *Confirmed.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined -- *Primary scenarios covered for all 3 chapters.*
- [x] Edge cases are identified -- *Version compatibility and complexity covered.*
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded -- *Limited to 3 chapters and specific ROS 2 components.*
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified -- *Target audience defined.*

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria -- *Aligned with user stories.*
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows -- *Covers fundamentals, AI bridge, and body mapping.*
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria -- *Aligns with Docusaurus and clarity goals.*
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification -- *Stays at the 'what' level for course content.*

## Notes

- The specification is ready for planning. No clarifications are required as the user provided a clear structure.
